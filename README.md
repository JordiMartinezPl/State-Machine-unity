# State-Machine-unity



Hello everyone! This university practice session focuses on developing a state machine in Unity to manage enemy behaviors. The enemies are programmed to chase, patrol, and stop based on different triggers and states within the game environment. This practice is designed to enhance understanding of AI programming in game development. Special thanks to the University for providing guidance and resources for this exercise. teammates: David Samaniego, Xavier Miguel, Oriol Renom.
